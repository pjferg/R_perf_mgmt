Getting to Know R: Exploring the AFL Data Set
================

## Overview

In this tutorial, I will show you how to setup R, perform some basic
commands, and explore the data set we discussed in class. The purpose of
this tutorial is to get you started with R and to help you understand
the properties of the data set. You will also learn some of the
most-commonly used functions in R. I don’t expect you to be able to
write R code from scratch (at this stage), so I will give you help along
the way.

I wrote and compiled this document in R using Markdown (R can do lots of
things beyond just analysing data). Via this document, I will walk you
through a number of steps. For each of these steps, I will provide some
background and basic instructions, then I will provide the code as well
as the output generated by this code. You can copy and paste the code
into your own R script. If you have set everything up correctly on your
own machine, when you run this code, you should see the same (or
similar) output to that which is reported in this document.

### Install R and RStudio

Before we dive into the data, you need to install R and RStudio. Both
are freely available online. This installation process is straight
forward and there is lots of trouble-shooting advice and guidance online
if you run into any problems (feel free to email me if you have any
issues that you can’t solve after a few Google searches).

To install R, go to <https://cloud.r-project.org/> Follow the prompts
and be sure to install the latest version.

To install RStudio, go to
<https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/> Follow the prompts and
be sure to install the latest version.

### Open RStudio and explore the environment

With both programs installed, you should now open RStudio. On first
glance, you will have a lot to take in. However, RStudio is less complex
than it initially looks. The interface consists of four main panels: the
source editor, the console, the environment pane and the browser pane.

For most applications, you will work with RStudio in the following
manner. You will write and run your code from a script in the source
editor. Output from your code is repoted in the console. If you created
an object with your code (e.g., data frame/tibble, function, etc), you
can interact with this object in the environment pane. For instance, you
can open and inspect your data from here. Finally, you can view your
files/directory and plots in the browser pane.

The following video provides a useful overview of the RStudio interface
(as well as information on how to install R and RStudio - helpful if you
ran into trouble on the previous step):

### Set up your directory, and save data set

With the installation out of the way, you are now ready to start working
in R. First, you need to set up your directory. R needs to pull and push
files from and to somewhere. This somewhere is your working directory.
You can set up your directory in a number of different ways. I am going
to have you to do so by running your first piece of R code.

To begin, you need to open an R script by using the menu that drops down
from the top-left icon:

![](Images/open_script.png)

In the script you have opened, you now need enter a command to set the
working directory. For simplicitly, you can set your directory to the
desktop. If you are working on a Mac, you will need to type something
like the following:

``` r
setwd("/Users/username/Desktop")
```

If you are working on a Windows computer, you will need to type
something like the following:

``` r
setwd("C:\Users\username\Desktop")
```

You will need to adapt the code I provided above to match the naming
conventions on your machine (i.e., substitute in your own username,
etc). On my machine - a Mac - I type and run the following line of code:

![](Images/run_set_wd.png)

As shown in the screenshot above, to run a chunk of code in the editor,
simply select the line/s of code you want to run and then click on the
‘Run’ icon in the source editor pane (alternatively, if you are on a
Mac, you can highlight the code and hit Ctrl+Enter). You will see the
same line of code show up in the console pane below the source editor
(if it is accompanied by an error message, something has gone wrong and
your working directory will not be set to the desktop).

Having set your working directory, you now want to store the raw data
file we will be working with on the desktop.

First, you need to download the AFL data set from the course website.
The data set can be accessed here: ….

Next, you need to move this file to the desktop on your computer. Once
you have done this, the data set should show up as a csv file in the
browser pane of your RStudio interface.

You want to see something that looks like the following:

### Install and load packages

As I mentioned in my lecture, you will primarily be working with the
‘tidyverse’ set of packages. As such, you will need to install and
load the tidyverse package. Installing packages in R is straight-forward
and follows the same basic convention: specify the name of the package
you want to install in the install.packages function.

To install the tidyverse package, you will need to type the following
line of code in your script and hit run (just like I showed you above
when you set the working directory):

``` r
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Once you have run this line of code, you should see some output show up
in the console. This output will identify the package you are
downloading and provide you with some additional information. Now that
you have installed the tidyverse package, you now need to load this
package for use. To do so, you need to run the following line of code:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

Great. You are now ready to get your hands dirty. One final thing I will
mention is that you do not need to install a package every time you want
to use it. Once a packaged has been installed, it will remains on your
local machine. However, you do need to load installed packages each time
your start a new session in R. A good habit to get into is to start each
of your scripts with a chunk of code that loads all the packages that
you commonly use.

### Load data set

You can now load the AFL data set. To do so, copy the following line of
code to you script and run it in from the source editor:

``` r
AFL_data_set <- read_csv("AFL_data_set.csv")
```

Most of the code you will write in R follows this same basic structure:
you are using a function - read\_csv( ) - to transform an input (our raw
data from the csv file) - into an R object - the ‘tibble’ (i.e., the
tidy-version of a data frame), ‘AFL\_data\_set’.

If all goes as planned, you should see ‘AFL\_data\_set’ show up in the
environment pane:

![](Images/enviro_pane.png)

If you click on ‘AFL\_data\_set’, a spreadsheet-tyle viewer will display
the data in the source editor:

![](Images/viewer.png)

### Examine the contents and structure of the data set

Alternatively, to get a snapshot of the first ten rows of the data set,
as well as discription of its structure and contents, you can simply
type the name of the object in your script and hit run:

``` r
AFL_data_set
```

    ## # A tibble: 1,474 x 14
    ##    Game_ID Player_ID Position GameTotalMins GameTotalDistan… Disposals
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>            <dbl>            <dbl>     <dbl>

    ##  2       1         5 DEFENCE          115.              14.2        21
    ##  3       1         6 MIDFIELD          90.1             12.3        12
    ##  4       1         7 DEFENCE          110.              13.2        19
    ##  5       1         8 FORWARD          109.              15.2        14

    ##  7       1        14 MIDFIELD         108.              14.3        17
    ##  8       1        16 MIDFIELD          95.8             11.9        21
    ##  9       1        21 DEFENCE          108.              13.8        11
    ## 10       1        22 MIDFIELD          91.8             12.0        14
    ## # … with 1,464 more rows, and 8 more variables: Disposal_efficiency <dbl>,
    ## #   Goals <dbl>, Tackles <dbl>, Marks <dbl>, Clearances <dbl>,
    ## #   Margin <dbl>, Rainfall_mm <dbl>, Wind_mph <dbl>

You should see some output (a crude table) pop up in your console. What
can we learn from this output?

  - The top row tells us that the object ‘AFL\_data\_set’ is a tibble of
    dimensions 1474x14. That is, our data set contains 1474 rows (or
    observations) and 14 variables (or measures).
      - As I explained in class, each row is a player-game observation
        (i.e., a player’s performance measures for an individual game).
  - The second row down gives us the names of the first eight variables
    in our data set. The notes at the bottom of the table tell us that
    there are ‘6 more variables’ not reported in the output.
      - This is a limit of viewing a data set in this fashion: if the
        data set is ‘too wide’, you only see the first few variables.
  - The third row down tells us the ‘types’ of variables in our data
    set. You can think of ‘dbl’ as a number, and you can think of ‘chr’
    as words.
  - From the fourth row down, you can see the actual data (or
    observations) in our data set.

While this output provides a useful overview of our data set, another
helpful way to explore our data is to run the follow command, which
outputs the first ten rows of the data in a slightly easier-to-read
structure:

``` r
knitr::kable(AFL_data_set[1:10,])
```

To get a better sense of how to interpret the contents of our data set,
I will interpret the first row reported above.

  - In Game\_ID=1, Player\_ID=2, a defender, played 108.5 minutes of
    game time during which he ran 13.3 km. He accumulated a total of 17
    disposals, at an efficiency rate of 58.8%. He kicked 0 goals,
    completed 4 tackles, took 5 marks, and completed 2 clearances. His
    team lost the game by 30 points. During the game, there was 1.2mm of
    rainfall, and the average windspeed was 16 miles per hour.

### Creating variables

Now that you have a handle on our data set, I am going to get you to
create some new variables. You will use the function mutate() to create
these variables. I will also get you to use pipes (%\>%) to string
together a pieces of code. You should get in the habit of using pipes.
They can help you to compartmentalize blocks of complex code. Pipes also
make your code easier to read - something you will appreciate if you
ever have to return to and work with a piece of code you wrote in the
distant past.

First, I will get you to create a variable that measures running
distance in meters per minute of game time. To generate this variable,
you need to run the following chunk of code:

``` r
AFL_data_set <- AFL_data_set %>%
  mutate(Meters_per_min=(GameTotalDistance_km*1000)/GameTotalMins)
```

Second, I will get you to create a variable that indicates (i.e., takes
a value of one) if a player kicked 2+ goals in a game and also ran 14+
km. To generate this variable - which we will call ‘best\_on\_ground’ -
you need to run the following chunk of code:

``` r
AFL_data_set <- AFL_data_set %>%
  mutate(best_on_ground=ifelse(Goals >= 2 & GameTotalDistance_km >= 14, 1, 0))
```

To confirm that your code ran as intended, you should take another quick
look at your data set to confirm that the new variables now show
up:

``` r
knitr::kable(AFL_data_set[1:10,])
```

| Game\_ID | Player\_ID | Position | GameTotalMins | GameTotalDistance\_km | Disposals | Disposal\_efficiency | Goals | Tackles | Marks | Clearances | Margin | Rainfall\_mm | Wind\_mph | Meters\_per\_min | best\_on\_ground |

### Subsetting our data

When you have large data sets, you will often only want to look at a
subset or snapshot of your data. In the case of wide data sets (i.e.,
many columns), you may want to only look at or work with a subset of
variables. In the case of long data sets (i.e., many rows), you may want
to only look at or work with a subset of observations.

You can use the function select( ) to ‘narrow’ a wide data set (i.e.,
drop variables). For example, let’s say we want to create a tibble that
contains the following four variables from our AFL data set: Player\_ID,
Game\_ID, and the two new variables we just created (Meters\_per\_min,
and best\_on\_ground). You can run the following code to create this
‘narrow’ data set:

``` r
narrow <- AFL_data_set %>%
  select(Player_ID, Game_ID, Meters_per_min, best_on_ground)
```

If we take a quick peek at this new tibble, you can see that it contains
only the four variables that we wanted from our original, wider data
set:

``` r
knitr::kable(narrow[1:10,])
```

| Player\_ID | Game\_ID | Meters\_per\_min | best\_on\_ground |

If you want to ‘shorten’ a long data set (i.e, drop observations), you
can use the filter( ) command. For example, the following piece of code
creates a tibble that only contains observations from our AFL data set
for which best\_on\_ground=1 (i.e., observations where the player scored
2+ goals in the game and ran more than 14 km):

``` r
short <- AFL_data_set %>%
  filter(best_on_ground==1)
```

You should then be able to see that this new tibble only contains
observations from the AFL data set for which
best\_on\_ground=1:

``` r
knitr::kable(short[1:10,])
```

### Summarizing our data

When working with data, one of the very first things you will want to do
is summarize the variables of interest in your data set. This is because
it is often not feasible to look at the value a variable takes for every
observation in the data set (and even if doing so was feasible, it is
not clear what you would learn by just ‘eye-balling’ the data).
Statistics tells us that a good way to summarize a variable is describe
its distribution. I will show you two common, easy-to-interpret ways to
do this.

You can calculate the summary statistics of a variable. I will get you
to use the summary () function to do this for the variable
GameTotalDistance\_km:

``` r
summary(AFL_data_set$GameTotalDistance_km)
```

    ##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
    ##  0.1829 12.2714 13.1155 12.9939 14.0226 17.0754

A downside of the summary() function is that it lacks many of the
statistics we commonly use in economics and data science (e.g, standard
deviation, etc). An alternative approach is to use the stargazer()
function from the stargazer package (to use this papproach you will need
to install and load the stargazed package). Stargazer produces the
following output, which provides a compact overivew of the summary
statistics for all the variables in our data set (NB Stargazer does not
take tibbles as an input, hence why you need to convert the data to a
data frame within the function):

``` r
stargazer(data.frame(AFL_data_set), type = "html")
```

You can also summarize a variable by visualizing its distribution. A
common way to do so is to produce a density plot (you should have seen
these in your statistics or econometrics courses). A density plot is
like a smoothed version of a histogram; it tells you plots the values of
the variable on the x-axis and how often those values show up in the
data set for that variable on the y-axis.

If you run the following chunk of code, you will get a density plot for
the variable GameTotalDistance\_km This plot provides captures the full
distribution, rather than just a subet of the distribution’s ‘moments’
(.e.g, mean, variance,
etc.):

``` r
plot(density(AFL_data_set$GameTotalDistance_km), main='Total Distance Run',
     xlab='Km')
```

![](Tutorial_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png)<!-- -->

This plot is pretty informative (we see that a player runs around 13km
in a typical game; some players run a bit more, some players run a lot
less), but it also masks a lot of cross-sectional variation. For
instance, how does the distribution of running distance vary by playing
position? With R, this sort of analysis is fairly trivial to execute -
just run a piece of code like the
following:

``` r
plot(density(filter(AFL_data_set, Position == "MIDFIELD")$GameTotalDistance_km), col='red', main='Total Distance Run',
     xlab='Km')
lines(density(filter(AFL_data_set, Position == "FORWARD")$GameTotalDistance_km), col="blue")
lines(density(filter(AFL_data_set, Position == "DEFENCE")$GameTotalDistance_km), col="green")
legend("topright", legend=c("Midfield", "Forward", "Defender"),
       col=c("red", "blue", "green"), lty=1, cex=0.8)
```

### Explore relationships between variables

Most of the time when we work with data, we aren’t just interested in
looking at variables by themselves. Instead, we most often want to know
how variables can be related to each other. How are variables
correlated? How can one variable be used to predict another? How does
one variable cause another? To answer these sorts of questions, we need
to understand how variables are related (we also need to impose a set of
assumptions on the underlying data generating process if we want to make
causal claims). While we won’t cover the later in detail in this module,
we will teach you how to do the former - i.e., understand whether one
variable is associated with another variable.

Fist, you use plots and other visuals to understand whether variables
are associated with one another. For example, let’s look at the
relationship between the total number of goals kicked by a team and the
final margin of the game. As these variables are by definition
mechanically related, we expect a strong positive relationship to show
up in our plot. To produce a scatter plot of these variables, you can
run the following code (NB that before you plot the raw variables, you
need to aggreate the player-level data to the team-level, hence the use
of the group\_by() function in the code):

``` r
grouped <- AFL_data_set %>%
  group_by(Game_ID) %>%
  summarise(total_goals=sum(Goals), margin=mean(Margin))

plot(grouped$total_goals, grouped$margin,
     xlab='Total Goals', ylab='Margin')
```

![](Tutorial_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png)<!-- -->

Although it is not terribly suprising, the plot above shows a strong
positive relationship between the total number of goals a team scores
and the final margin of the game.

Second, we can quantify the association between two variables by
calculating their correlation. R provides a function that allows you to
do just this, which we use in the line of code below to look at the
association between the total number of goals a team scores and the
final margin of the game:

``` r
cor(grouped$total_goals, grouped$margin)
```

    ## [1] 0.772114

Third, we can also use a regression to quantify the association between
two variables. A neat feature of regression is that it also allows us to
include additional variables (‘controls’) in the model. This can be
espcially powerful if we suspect that a confounding variable is creating
(or masking) a relationship between the two variables of interest.

In the follow examples, we will regress margin on total goals by using
the lm() function. The first model you will run assumes a simple linear
relationship between margin and goals; the second model you will run
allows for the weather conditions at the ground to affect both the
number of goals a team scores and the margin of the game.

``` r
summary(lm(margin~total_goals, data = grouped))
```

    ## 
    ## Call:
    ## lm(formula = margin ~ total_goals, data = grouped)
    ## 
    ## Residuals:

As we can see in the above output, the coefficient on total\_goals is
both positive and statistically significant at the 1% level. This is not
a great revelation, but it nonetheless makes sense: teams that kick more
goals, win games by a greater margin.

As a quick aside, you may be wondering why the coefficient on
total\_goals is larger than six (i.e., the number of points a team
scores when they kick a goal). I’ll leave it to you to work out why this
might be the case - but I will provide a hint: because game time is
finite, when a team scores a goal, this imposes an opportunity cost on
the opposition…

### Recap and conclusion

In this tutorial, I will show you how to setup R, perform some basic
commands, and explore the data set we discussed in class. This should
put you in good stead to work through the exercise we are going to
tackle next in class. This exercise will deal much more directly with
many of the concepts related to performance management that you have
discussed in this course.

Hopefully, this tutorial has also given you taste for the sort of
analysis you can perform using R. As I stated earlier in class, R is
great language that you learn on your own using free online resources.
And, one final comment: What I have taught you has real-world
applications; in fact, it is excatly the sort of basic ‘data science’
work that goes on in industry. As such, many employers are very keen to
hire graduates for accounting and finance roles that have a solid grasp
of R…
