# Applying Concepts From Performance Management: Using R to Work With Performance Data

This repo contains the class materials, code, and data for the University of Melbourne module on performance management, data science, and R.

The contents of each folder in the repo is fairly self-explanatory.

## Lecture 

This folder contains the slides covered in class. Click on the pdfs to view the slides.

## Preparation

This folder contains everything you will need to complete the class's data task. 

Click on **Preparation.md** to open and view the preparation material for the data task. You can work your way through this document on your own before our live workshop. 

**AFL_data_set.csv** contains the data set for the data task. **Data dictionary.csv** is the code book for the data set you will use for the data task.

You need to complete this preparation task before the workshop.

## Workshop

This folder contains everything you will need to follow along and participate in the class's workshop. For the live workshop session, we will use the same data set as you used for the preparation task. More generally, I will assume you have completed the preparation task prior to the workshop. 

Click on **Workshop.md** to open and view the questions for the workshop. You should look at these before the workshop. I do not expect you to come to the session with fully formed answers (and code), but I expect you to have thought about the questions and how you might answer them.

**Workshop_code.R** contains the code we will run during the workshop. Feel free to run this code before class. That said, I will work through each question and the associated code in detail in class.

## Resources and Papers 

This folder contains background/additional material on performance management and R.
