# Questions for live R workshop on performance measures

1. How are the performance measures distributed? Start by using **stargazer()** and then plot the density of two variables, goals and disposals.
	1. Is it good or bad for a measure to have high variance (think in terms of the trade-off between sensitivity and noise)?
	2. How can thinking in terms of changes help us understand the properties of performance measures? What can we learn by looking at disposals in t-1 and disposals in t?
